            <h3>AI <span>enthusiast</span></h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph">I am a final-year engineering student at the Higher School of Communication in Tunis, with a strong passion for AI and Generative AI. My interest in AI began during my preparatory school years when I attended a conference titled "The Power of AI." That experience sparked my curiosity and inspired me to explore this fascinating field.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Throughout my two years in preparatory school, I developed strong skills in mathematics, including calculus and linear algebra, and gained a solid foundation in computer science by mastering Python. I successfully passed the national competitive examinations for admission to engineering training cycles, ranking 44 out of 1400, and was selected to attend one of the top engineering universities in Tunisia.</p>
        
            <p class="about-paragraph">My journey at the Higher School of Communication has further deepened my interest in AI. I have explored various domains, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, through coursework and labs. I have also participated in numerous events, winning hackathons that provided me with valuable experience in developing innovative solutions within the AI domain.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">In addition, I have gained essential soft skills such as leadership, by leading multiple projects in hackathons, clubs and academic projects, as well as effective team collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving. These skills have enabled me to manage complex tasks, work well under pressure, and communicate efficiently within diverse teams.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">I am proud of the projects I have completed, such as the text generation application, user dashboard with chatbot, Cloud Native e-commerce application with DevOps automation, my chatbot, text summarizer, and plant disease detection system. These experiences have fueled my thirst for knowledge and my desire to expand my skills. I am highly motivated to take on more projects and continue pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in this exciting field.</p>
