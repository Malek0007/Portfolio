                <h3>Platform Description</h3>
                
                        <p>
                            Once authenticated, the user can access the platform. It is based on a microservices architecture: 
                            customer, shopping, and product, allowing users to browse products, purchase them, add them to their 
                            cart, and save them to a wishlist if available. The platform also provides detailed cost breakdowns 
                            for each product, aiming to offer the best possible user experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>DevOps Architecture Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            To transform each microservice into a container, I used Docker. I tested the communication through 
                            RabbitMQ. In this case, when the specific client server is stopped, I observed the sending of a 
                            message indicating this. The message remains in the queue until the server is back online and 
                            receives it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, the deployment on Azure Cloud was a crucial step. Utilizing Azure's cloud computing 
                            services allowed me to deploy the application flexibly and scalably, tailored to the growing needs 
                            of users. I took advantage of Azure's auto-scaling capabilities. Additionally, Azure’s built-in monitoring and error 
                            management tools helped me maintain high availability and respond quickly to potential issues, 
                            ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted user experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            The implementation of the CI/CD pipeline for the IoT smart home product sales platform led to 
                            several benefits. Firstly, it enabled faster and more efficient delivery of new features and bug 
                            fixes, reducing time to market. Secondly, it improved platform quality by automatically testing code 
                            changes and detecting bugs early in the development phases. Thirdly, it increased platform reliability 
                            by automating the deployment process and ensuring consistency across all environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the testing phase, I identified several bugs that would have gone unnoticed without 
                            automated testing. This underscores the importance of testing in the software development process and 
                            the added value that CI/CD pipelines can bring by detecting bugs early. The deployment process was 
                            also made more efficient and reliable through the use of Kubernetes. The ability to deploy container 
                            images on Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes manifests ensured consistency across environments and 
                            reduced the likelihood of deployment errors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, I made every effort to deliver a production-ready final product by focusing on error 
                            management. By integrating robust error-handling mechanisms into the pipeline, I was able to identify, 
                            log, and proactively fix errors before they affected end users. This not only improved the user 
                            experience but also strengthened the stability and resilience of the platform. Thanks to this 
                            proactive approach, I successfully delivered a reliable, high-quality solution ready for deployment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the CI/CD pipeline for the IoT smart home product sales platform has proven to be a valuable 
                            addition to the software development process. It enabled me to deliver new features and bug fixes 
                            more efficiently, improve the quality and reliability of the platform, and detect bugs early in the 
                            development process. The use of open-source tools such as Jenkins, GitLab, Docker, and Kubernetes made 
                            the implementation of the pipeline cost-effective and accessible for small and medium enterprises 
                            specializing in IoT smart home products.
